## 🧪 Testing

**Frontend**: Jest + React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E.

**Backend (planned)**: JUnit, Mockito, Spring MockMvc.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

* **Frontend**: build with `npm run build`, deploy static assets to Vercel/Netlify or Nginx.
* **Backend**: containerize, push to **GCR**, deploy to **GKE** with Helm/Kustomize.
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for lint/test/build/deploy.

## 🔒 Security Notes

* Role‑based access control (candidate/interviewer)
* JWT access tokens; refresh tokens; secure cookie options in production
* CSRF protection for non‑idempotent routes; strict CORS
* Rate limiting on auth and booking endpoints
* WebSocket auth via token on connect

---

## 📊 Performance & Observability

* Redis caching for slot lookups and session presence
* Zipkin for distributed tracing across API calls & WS events
* Prometheus metrics: latency, error rate, WS connections, queue depth
* Frontend Web Vitals reporting (CLS/LCP/TTI)

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap / Future Work

* [x] Frontend MVP with mocks
* [x] Spring Boot backend with REST + WS
* [ ] CI/CD pipelines (Actions)
* [ ] GKE deployment with autoscaling
* [ ] Interviewer dashboards & analytics
* [ ] Calendar sync (Google/Microsoft)
* [ ] Payments (Stripe) for premium features
